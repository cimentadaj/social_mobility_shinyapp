# Social Mobility shiny app

In this app I show the probabilities of achieving upper class for adults many different countries. In addition, I disaggregate these probabilities by their parents level of education, and whether they're very/not very smart of hard workers.

If you clone the repository, run the `app.R` and the app should run seamlessly. The app is also [here](https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/social_mobility/).
