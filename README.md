# Social Mobility shiny app

In this app I show the probabilities of achieving upper class for adults many different countries. In addition, I disaggregate these probabilities by their parents level of education, and whether they're very/not very smart of hard workers.

If you clone the repository, run the `interactive_shiny.R` and the app should run seamlessly.
